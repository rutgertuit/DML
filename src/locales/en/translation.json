Number them for clarity. Keep it concise (under 150 words total).\n- After their reply, synthesize: Update the draft prompt, show diffs (e.g., \"Added: target=beginners\"), and ask 1-2 follow-ups if needed. Cap at 2 rounds.\n- End by generating the final prompt. You MUST wrap this final, complete prompt in a single, non-nested code block, starting *exactly* with `[FINAL_PROMPT]` and ending *exactly* with `[/FINAL_PROMPT]`.\n- After the `[/FINAL_PROMPT]` tag, you MUST add a concluding sign-off (e.g., 'Here's the refined prompt, ready to use in Gemini!' ).\n- **Crucially, after you use the `[FINAL_PROMPT]` tags, your turn is over. You MUST NOT ask any more follow-up questions.**\n- If they say \"stop\" or \"finalize,\" output the prompt immediately.\n- Stay fun and encouraging: End responses with a micro-tip (e.g., \"Pro tip: Specificity = magic!\").",

    "faq1": {
      "myth": "AI will replace my job",
      "truth": "AI amplifies your work, it doesn't replace your judgment",
      "explanation": "Think of AI like Excel. Did spreadsheets replace financial analysts? No‚Äîthey made them more powerful. AI is the same. It handles the repetitive stuff (first drafts, research summaries, data formatting) so you can focus on strategy, creativity, and decisions that actually need a human. The people who get replaced are the ones who refuse to learn the new tool."
    },
    "faq2": {
      "myth": "You need to be 'technical' to use AI",
      "truth": "If you can write a Google Search, you can use AI",
      "explanation": "There's no coding required. You're already doing the hard part‚Äîyou know your job, your audience, and what good work looks like. AI just needs you to explain it clearly. The Prompt Improver on this site literally walks you through it, question by question. If you can answer 'Who is this for?' and 'What's the goal?'‚Äîyou're 90% there."
    },
    "faq3": {
      "myth": "AI just hallucinates nonsense",
      "truth": "AI gives you what you ask for. Bad input = bad output.",
      "explanation": "Yes, AI can make stuff up‚Äîif you let it. But that's like blaming a junior employee for doing exactly what you told them (poorly). The tools on this site teach you how to give AI the right context, constraints, and examples so it can't go off the rails. With the right prompt, AI is shockingly accurate. With a vague one? You get nonsense."
    },
    "faq4": {
      "myth": "AI is just a fad / will be replaced soon",
      "truth": "AI is infrastructure now, not a trend",
      "explanation": "This isn't like NFTs or the metaverse. AI is already baked into Gmail (Smart Compose), Google Docs (grammar suggestions), and your phone's autocorrect. The question isn't 'Will AI stick around?'‚Äîit's 'Will you learn to use it before your competition does?' In 5 years, using AI will be as basic as using email."

      "myth": "I tried ChatGPT once, it didn't work for me",
      "truth": "You tried a screwdriver to hammer a nail. Wrong tool, wrong technique.",
      "explanation": "ChatGPT is one tool. It's great for some things (brainstorming, drafting), terrible for others (citations, grounded research). This site shows you the full toolkit: Prompt Improver for better instructions, NotebookLM for research, Hero Gems for specialized tasks. Saying 'AI doesn't work' after one bad ChatGPT experience is like saying 'Google doesn't work' because you mistyped a search once."
